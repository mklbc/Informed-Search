1. Presenting the Task as a Search Task
The problem is framed as a search task where we are given a start node and a goal node in a graph. The goal is to find the optimal path from the start to the goal using informed search algorithms. The search graph includes nodes with heuristic values, which are estimates of the cost to reach the goal. These estimates will guide the search process.
2. Constructing the Search Graph
The search graph is constructed by defining nodes and the transitions between them. Each transition has a cost, and each node has a heuristic value that estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal. The graph is designed such that we can apply informed search algorithms, such as Greedy Search, A*, and Iterative A*.
3. Implementation of Informed Search Algorithms
Here is a Python implementation of the three informed search algorithms: Greedy Search, A*, and Iterative A*.
